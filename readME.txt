All .h files and .cpp compile.

However, the member functions encodedMessage(string)
and decode(string) doesn't work properly.

The program will check if the file can be open if not 
the program force exits. 

All in all, messageServer works perfectly in main, encodedServer in main
hasn't been fully implemented due to encodedMessage(string).

There's also an empty line after client 2's input. press enter then proceed
